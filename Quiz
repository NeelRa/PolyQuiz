Explain what inheritance is.
Ans) Inheritance in java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of parent object.
     Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes.
     Inheritance in JAVA lets you create classes that are derived from other classes. It is a class that is based
     on some other class and it inherits that class. We call the class that is inherited by others as superclass. And the
     class that does inheriting is the subclass. A subclass automatically takes on all the behavior and attributes
     of its base class. To create a subclass, you use the "extends" keyword on the class declaration to indicate 
     the name of the base class. The subclass automatically inherits the class body of the base class, so any methods
     or fields that are defined by the base class will automatically be included in the subclass. 


Explain what polymorphism is.
Ans) Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs 
     when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. Subclasses of a class can define their own
     unique behaviors and yet share some of the same functionality of the parent class. Subclasses of a class can define
     their own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same functionality of the parent class. Method Overloading 
     and Method Overriding are some of the concepts that demonstrates different types of Polymorphism.
